# ClipArt Python Script

This repository contains a small Python script to generate cartoon-style ClipArt.  

## Description

Microsoft 365 no longer provides ClipArt, so this script was created to generate custom ClipArt. The script produces text with:

- Blue fill color (`#4F88C6`)
- Thick black cartoon-style outline
- Horizontal text, all letters on the same line
- Adjustable spacing and margins
- White background

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.10+ recommended).  
2. Install the required package:
pip install pillow
3. Run the script:
python clipart_generator.py
4. Enter your text in the GUI and save the generated ClipArt in PNG format.
